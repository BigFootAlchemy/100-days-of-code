# Project Outline : ComicSans
* I have nearly 100GB of digitial comics i have collected over the years. The majority of them are marvel 
* They are currently stored in my google drive but would like to have them removed and placed up to s3 
* The idea is to have them sorted, indexed, and ordered by name for easy searching
* Once in s3, I will use the athena query for easier sorting like a mysql database 
* The remaining steps for the 100 day challenge will to add a web interface and added feature to learn more about the character or comic via the Marvel api
